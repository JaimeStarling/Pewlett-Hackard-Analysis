# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Using employee data, we have determined how many employees at Pewlett Hackard are in a position to retire soon, followed by employees who qualify for a potential mentorship program.

## Results

- Of Pewlett Hackard’s current “Late-Boomer” employees, born between 1952 and 1965, 72,458 (30%) were born between 1952 and 1955, putting them in or nearing retirement age. 

- Each department that includes both engineers and supporting staff will be the worst affected as the majority of potential retirees are from those categories. In the figure below, engineers make up 36,291 of employees who could soon leave, and staff make up 32,562. 


- In searching for potential candidates for the mentorship program, we took a sample of employees born in the year 1965, a good ten years later than the youngest potential retiree. In the figure below, there are 1,549 employees born in 1965, of which 748 in engineering qualify and 724 in supporting staff qualify.

- More than half of the 1965-born qualifying engineers are due for promotion, and just under half of the 1965-born qualifying staff are due for promotion. These will be the ones more interested in the mentorship program, and may work a little longer than they personally planned once promoted.

## Summary
Losing nearly one third of the people at Pewlett Hackard is not the only problem nor is it something just for human resources to ponder. Pewlett Hackard could potentially lose decades’ worth of institutional knowledge, all within a few years. Action is required immediately, and one suggestion is to offer promotion for those in the retirement category who are not holding senior positions They can even participate in the mentorship program until there is an opening among senior positions if departments run by “first in, first out.”. This may encourage them to stay a little longer, saving some time and money on turnovers.

Pewlett Hackard will want to address the salary discrepancies shown in this figure. Some lower-ranking engineers are being paid more than senior engineers, for example, and such information often leaks to other employees, causing frustration and more interest in retiring or leaving for another company.

If all of the employees born in 1965 are interested in the mentorship program, that is already ten percent or so of coverage in some departments, as seen in this figure. And thankfully Pewlett Hackard did not stop hiring anyone born after 1965. Early-GenXers are going to bring larger numbers to the mentorship program if expanded to them.
